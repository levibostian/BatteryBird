# BatteryBird

### Import all of your bluetooth devices

Devices that you have added to your Android device in the Settings app can be imported to quickly begin monitoring battery levels.

> After you accept bluetooth permission, the app will instantly show you all of the bluetooth devices added to your Android device. If any of those devices are currently connected to your device, the battery level will be shown in the app. 

![main app screen showing you a list of fake bluetooth devices before you accept bluetooth device access permission. this is a demo mode of the app.](docs/img/screenshot-demo-mode.jpg)
> Before you accept bluetooth permission, the app runs in a Demo mode to let you try the app before giving it permission. 

### Add other bluetooth devices 

Add new bluetooth devices that are not registered to your Android device yet. Feature works great for some devices like smart watches that connect with their own proprietary app. 

![screen where you can manually add a new bluetooth device to the app by manually registering a MAC address](docs/img/screenshot-manually-add.jpg)
> The way to add new bluetooth devices is with a MAC address of the device. 

![in case you dont know what a MAC address is, the app provides a helpful message explaining it to you](docs/img/screenshot-manually-add-help.jpg)
> No worries if you don't know what a bluetooth MAC address is. I hope this message helps ðŸ˜„

### Rename devices 

Bluetooth devices come with a name that was created by the manufacturer. Sometimes this name is not helpful and it's best to rename it to something you will more easily remember.

> What is the Esinkin BT Adapter you might ask? It's my speakers in my upstairs office. I think "Office speakers" is a better name ðŸ˜‰

# Tech stack 

* **Jetpack Compose** to create the app's UI 
* **Kotlin Coroutines** to observe changes in the data of the app 
* **fastlane** to build and ship the app to Google Play from **GitHub Actions**
* **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** to implement the app's data store. Created to re-use the logic on other platforms such as iOS if I ever decided to build an iOS or macOS version of this app.
